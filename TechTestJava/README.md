Hello Candidate,

Welcome to AnyCompany Entertainment.

Here is our mostly complete system for placing orders.

The developer who created this system did not follow any specific development methodology, 
but attempted to implement some patterns. Unfortunately he has now left the company.

The system should do the following:

 * Place an order, linked to a customer
	Solution: placeOrder function in OrderService.java will take care of it now.
 * Retrieve a customer with their linked order(s)  
    Solution: retrieveCustomerById function in OrderService.java will handle it.
 * Load all customers and their linked orders
   Solution: retrieveAllCustomerWithOrders function in OrderService.java will handle it.

Please do not change any of the existing static class declarations to be non-static.

Please refactor the solution according to your own best practices.

**Please fork this repository and submit your attempt via a pull request**

Details on how to do this can be found in the [Github help pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

Best regards

John
CEO
